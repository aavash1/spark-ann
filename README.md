This is an implementation of Apache spark based processing of All-Nearest Neighbor Queries in a Road Network. The centralized version of this work is already my repository named as SQORN.

The required external JAR file is saved as "MESSIF.jar" and It helps to find a shortest path between two vertices. Includes YEN algorithm, huge thanks to the author. Original ksp.jar source can be found in "https://github.com/bsmock/k-shortest-paths".
